# Find-Missing-Grades
Create a report file which contains students' grades that have not passed from the old curriculum to the new one.

This program takes 4 csv files as input, it organize them in memory, it analize them, find the missing grades and finally export them to a report file. If any of the given files has syntax errors, a second report file is created reporting those errors.

Everything would be much easier if I had used the string class of the STL (Standard Template Library) but this was a restriction of the given instructions.
