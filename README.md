# Find-Missing-Grades
Creates a report file which contains students' grades that have not been transferred from the old curriculum to the new one.

This program takes 4 csv files as input, it organizes them in memory, it analizes them, find the missing grades and finally export them to a report file. If any of the given files has syntax errors, a second report file is created reporting those errors.

Everything would be much easier if I had use the string class of the STL (Standard Template Library) but this was a restriction of the given instructions.

Inside the csv folder there are some csv files with "faults" in their name. Those files have syntax errors.
